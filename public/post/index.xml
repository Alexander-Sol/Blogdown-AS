      <description>Collaborating using Git/hub and R-Studio When it comes to coding &amp;amp; data analysis, working with others can be a frustrating proposition. Links to files break when used on different machines, datasets become too large to share, and changes made in the code are impossible to keep straight. Luckily for us, a tool exists to solve (some) of these problems: Git. Git is a version control system. It allows you to take snapshots of your code as it changes over time.</description>

      <description>Using R on Indiana University’s High Performance Computing (HPC) Cluster When working with bioinformatics data, it’s only a matter of time until you encounter a problem too big to solve using your local machine. Transcriptomics is growing exponentially, but lab budgets are not. Whether you’re processing a multi-terabyte DNA-methylation dataset or attempting a gene set enrichment analysis with a 7 day run time, eventually you’ll need additional computational firepower to get the job done.</description>
